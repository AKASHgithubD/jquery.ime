Chuvash keyboard layouts
==========================

This directory contains different Chuvash keyboard layouts


Chuvash AltGr — Чăвашла AltGr
----------
The default keyboard layout in [chuvash.org](http://chuvash.org) which uses the standard Russian keyboard layouts plus additional four Chuvash letters. They are typed using the AltGr button. 

Unfortunately only in firefox AltGr combinations work well.
